  <h1>Lurie Attack</h1>
  <p>Lurie Children’s Hospital detected a breach of its systems on January 31, 2024. Lurie Children’s is one of the top-ranked pediatric hospitals in the country and one of the only Level I Pediatric Trauma Centers in all of Illinois… and it was forced to operate on pen and paper. Its patients include children with terminal illnesses and children requiring life-saving surgeries.</p>

  <h2>Attack path:</h2>
  <p>The attack targeted the hospital's MyChart electronic records system, leading to its temporary shutdown and the implementation of manual processes. As a result, patients experienced longer wait times for prescription requests, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of ransomware attacks on critical healthcare services.</p>

  <p>The MyChart electronic system has been the target or the affected target of multiple RaaS groups attacks such as in the instance of Virginia Mason Franciscan Health (), Norton HealthCare (AlphV,Black cat's attack), Laurie's Children Hospital, and CommonSpirit Health, Tampa General Hospital, Scripps Health, St Margaret's</p>

  <p>The statement did little to assuage the anger of customers across the U.S. who reported having issues at their local hospital or with their doctor. Several patients said their doctors were having problems accessing the MyChart tool, which is produced by a company called Epic Systems.</p>

  <p>An Epic Systems spokesperson said the outages were “an isolated incident with one customer: CommonSpirit Health.”</p>

  <p>However it is doubtful. Taking a look at Epic System Services, we can see that they are one of the primary providers for the Health Tools and electronic health records , <a href="https://signin.epic.com/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=https%3a%2f%2fuserweb.epic.com%2f&wctx=rm%3d1%26id%3dpassive%26ru%3d%252F&wct=2024-03-09T06%3a08%3a46Z&wreply=https%3a%2f%2fuserweb.epic.com%2f">https://signin.epic.com/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=https%3a%2f%2fuserweb.epic.com%2f&wctx=rm%3d1%26id%3dpassive%26ru%3d%252F&wct=2024-03-09T06%3a08%3a46Z&wreply=https%3a%2f%2fuserweb.epic.com%2f</a>
  We can see that most affected hospital entities utilize some sort of Epic System Software.</p>
